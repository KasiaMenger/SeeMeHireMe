    <h5>What to talk about in your video</h5>
    <ul>
      Here's few tips:
      <li>Treat is as if it was an interview.</li>
      The goal of any interview is to determine whether the candidate will be
      outstanding in the job, and that means evaluating the skills and attitude
      required for that job. Talk about
      <strong>why</strong>
      you took certain jobs. Explain why you left. Explain why you chose a
      certain school. Discuss why you took time off, and what you got out of the
      experience.
      <br />
      <li>Mention your biggest strengths.</li>
      Be clear and precise. Provide sharp, on-point examples of
      <strong>what</strong>
      are your greatest attributes. Don't just claim to have certain attributes
      - prove you have them.
      <br />
      <li>Describe your passions, desires and commitment.</li>
      Talk about how the position you want to be hired for is a perfect fit for
      what you want to accomplish.
      <br />
      <li>
        And finally make sure to fit all that in the 2 minutes video frame.
      </li>
      Good Luck!
    </ul>
